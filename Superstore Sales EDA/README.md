# Exploratory Data Analysis of Superstore Sales - Zach Skiba

In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Superstore Sales dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and shipping patterns. The dataset includes transaction details such as order information, shipping modes, customer demographics, and product categories.


# Key Insights: 

1. Product Performance:
    - Technology generated the highest revenue, while Office Supplies had the highest quantity sold but lower total sales.
    - Binders and Paper were the most frequently purchased sub-categories, but Chairs and Phones generated the highest sales.
    - There is a weak correlation between total orders and total sales, meaning higher sales are not necessarily driven by frequent purchases.
2. Customer Behavior: 
    - Consumers were the largest customer segment, contributing the most to total sales.
    - Most customers were repeat buyers, indicating strong customer retention.
3. Regional and Shipping Insights: 
    - The West had the highest number of orders and total sales, with California, New York, and Texas being the top-performing states.
    - Standard Class was the most frequently chosen shipping method and also generated the highest total sales
4. Time Based Trends: 
    - Sales have increased over the years, with 2018 being the year with the highest total sales.   
    - November had the highest sales, likely due to holiday shopping, and Saturday was the best sales day of the week.
